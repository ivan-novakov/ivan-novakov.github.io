Some time ago I wrote a simple [Shibboleth authentication adapter for ZF1](http://blog.debug.cz/2012/03/shibboleth-authentication-adapter-for.html). Now I finally  began using [Zend Framework 2](http://framework.zend.com/) for more complex projects, which require [Shibboleth](http://shibboleth.net/) authentication. So I wrote a new version of the adapter to be used with ZF2. It can be used as a module or as a standalone library. The code is available through [Composer](http://getcomposer.org/). For more information see the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ivan-novakov/ZfcShib).
